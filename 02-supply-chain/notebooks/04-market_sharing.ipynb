    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A large company has two divisions: D1 and D2. The company supplies retailers with oil and spirit. The goal is to allocate each retailer to either division D1 or division D2. The allocated division will be the retailer’s supplier. As far as possible, the allocation must be made so that D1 controls 40% of the market and D2 the remaining 60%. The retailers in the table below are listed as M1 to M23. Each retailer has an estimated market for oil and spirit. Retailers M1 to M8 are in region 1, retailers M9 to M18 are in region 2, and retailers M19 to M23 are in region 3. Certain retailers are considered to have good growth prospects and categorized as group A and the others are in group B. Each retailer has a certain number of delivery points. \n",
