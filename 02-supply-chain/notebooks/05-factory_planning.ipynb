    "- One borer\n",
    "- One planer\n",
    "\n",
    "Each product has a defined profit contribution per unit sold (defined as the sales price per unit minus the cost of raw materials). In addition, the manufacturing of each product requires a certain amount of time on each machine (in hours). The profit and manufacturing time value are shown below. A dash indicates that the manufacturing process for the given product does not require that machine.\n",

    "The factory produces products six days a week using two eight-hour shifts per day. It may be assumed that each month consists of 24 working days. Also, for the purposes of this model, there are no production sequencing issues that need to be taken into account.\n",
